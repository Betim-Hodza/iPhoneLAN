No. If there was a workaround I was comfortable with, I’d have explained it earlier. In this case your proposed workarounds all rely on the implementation details of Personal Hotspot, and such implementation details might change over time.

Personal Hotspot is a user-level feature, and it’s a mistake to attempt to use it as a developer-level feature.```
